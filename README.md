Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

Welcome to Musicboxd!

This website allows users to create an account that serves as their "music box", storing their ratings and reviews of any songs they log.

Upon accessing the website, the user will see a screen welcoming them to Musicboxd, with buttons that allow them to log in or register for an account. If this is the user's first time using the website, they should press the "Register" button to create an account. When the user presses "Register", they will be prompted to input a username and a password, and then to confirm the password. If the username is already in use, the user will be notified and should choose a different username.
